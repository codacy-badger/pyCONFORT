"""
In this file, the program will split your data
into train and test, and then it'll determine
how good your model is as a predictor based on the
4 rules that we specified in Jeff's article
(R2 and Q2 of the test, k and R2 diff)


Also, add apply the "X random" method and tje Y random
method (they should be either in Mihais or Bens code)

Add options about PCAs using chunks of variables: the PCA
should be able to find the elbow in the scree plot, and then
grab that number of PCS to reduce the number of variables
(i.e. 20 variables correlated regarding sterics -- converted
to --  4 PCs used by the model, and the same for electronics,
and so on)
